### Other

- Make Node.js language bindings context aware (<https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/2841>)
  They don't have any dynamic global data, so all it takes is just declaring them as such
- Fix crash when attempting to load ancient languages via wasm (<https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/3068>)
- Use workspace dependencies for internal crates like Tree-sitter (<https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/3076>)
- Remove vendored wasmtime headers (https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/3084)
  When building rust binding, use wasmtime headers provided via cargo
  by the wasmtime-c-api crate.
- Fix invalid parse stack recursive merging with mismatched error cost (<https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/3086>)
  Allowing this invalid merge caused an invariant to be violated
  later on during parsing, when handling a later error.
- Fix regression in `subtree_compare` (<https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/3111>)
- docs: Add `Ohm` language parser (<https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/3114>)
- Delete `binding_files.rs` (<https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/3106>)
- **bindings**: Consistent wording (<https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/3096>)
- **bindings**: Ignore more artifacts (<https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/3119>)
