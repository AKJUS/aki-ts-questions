### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an infinite loop that could happen in some grammars during error recovery if the end of the file was reached.
* Fixed a parser-generation error where internal character set constants were given external linkage, which could cause linking errors on some platforms if multiple Tree-sitter parsers were linked into the same application.
