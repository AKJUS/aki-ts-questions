# Changelog

## [0.25.0] â€” 2025-02-01

### Notices

This is a large release. As such, a few major changes and how to adapt to them are outlined below:

- `web-tree-sitter` was rewritten in TypeScript. With that, we also now publish the sourcemaps, and debug builds for the library. We also publish *both* CommonJS and ESM modules.
- The internal ABI was bumped to 15. The main benefits this brings is that the language name, version, supertype info, and reserved words are added to the parsers. To use ABI 15, you must have a `tree-sitter.json` file in your repository, since the version information for the parser is pulled from this file.
- Parsing and Querying should be cancelled using the "progress callback", rather than setting a timeout or a cancellation flag, which are now deprecated. To do so, use the "parse/query with options" function in the bindings you choose to use, in the next release the old way of timing out parsing will be removed, which allows us to get rid of our dependency on the `time.h` headers in the core library.
- `MISSING` nodes can now be queried, and queries involving supertypes are properly validated now.
- In the DSL, there is now a `RustRegex` function, which takes in a Rust regex as a string. All of the capabilities of Rust's regex engine are available here, which allows for some nice features that aren't possible with JavaScript regexes.
- We've migrated our documentation to mdBook, and greatly improved the docs.
