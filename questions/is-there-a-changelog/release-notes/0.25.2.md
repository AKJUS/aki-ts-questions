### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a crash that could occur when loading WASM-compiled languages that were generated with an earlier version of the Tree-sitter CLI (#4210).
* Fixed incorrect tokenization when using WASM-compiled languages, if the language's external scanner did not assign to `result_symbol` (#4218)
* Fixed an infinite loop that could occur if external scanners returned empty extra tokens (#4213)

### Build

* Decreased the rustc version required to build the `tree-sitter-languages` and `tree-sitter` crates (#4221)
