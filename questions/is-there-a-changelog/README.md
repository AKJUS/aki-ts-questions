# Is There A Changelog?

[Starting from
0.20.8](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/discussions/1031#discussioncomment-5639228),
the description for releases should contain related information.
[Here](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/releases/tag/v0.20.8)
is an example.

A `CHANGELOG` was [added at one
point](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/commit/80a0f9110dc0e4b1a1ea427477b07ddd63c2184e) but [it got removed](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/3928).

Since the release notes are not under revision control, as a temporary
measure, some of the info may get duplicated here.
